                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Galgotias University. With a deep passion for building intelligent systems, I’ve led and developed several projects in AI, machine learning, full-stack development, and voice assistant technologies.<br>
                    As the Head of AI & Software Development at Cono AI, I enjoy creating solutions that blend innovation with usability — from AI-powered assistants to secure media players. I’m also a proud winner of the Smart India Hackathon and have completed industry-certified internships from Google, IBM, and AWS.<br>
                    This space is a glimpse into my journey — the projects I've built, the problems I've solved, and the vision I carry forward. Let’s build the future together.</p>

                            <p>Cono AI is an intelligent voice assistant crafted to make everyday computing smarter, faster, and more private. As the Head of AI & Software Development, I’ve helped shape Cono AI into a multifunctional assistant that not only answers general queries and coding questions but also supports real-world use cases like opening WhatsApp, playing media, and managing tasks — all without compromising user data.<br>
                                What sets Cono AI apart is its commitment to user privacy. All actions are performed locally, with no data being stored on the server or user device. The assistant also features a built-in marketplace and entertainment zone, offering a personalized digital experience.<br>
                                Built using Python, machine learning models, and custom GUI frameworks, Cono AI is a result of deep research, innovation, and a desire to make AI useful and accessible for everyone. It’s not just a project — it’s a vision to bring human-like intelligence into everyday interactions.</p>

Developed using Python (Tkinter, CustomTkinter) and VLC, this player offers a clean, intuitive interface and a seamless playback experience.<br>
                                One of its standout features is the 5GB free cloud storage per user, allowing users to stream content directly from a central server. But what truly makes V-Media Player unique is its timestamp system — users can mark, name, and revisit their favorite scenes while watching any media. These timestamps are stored locally in a JSON file, ensuring full control and privacy.<br>
                                From smooth video playback to intelligent scene tracking, the player is built to give users more than just entertainment — it offers a personal connection to the content they love. Whether you're watching a film or streaming educational videos, V-Media Player transforms your viewing experience with smart features that remember what you value most.</p>
